{-| Forbids exporting everything from a module.

Modules should have hidden implementation details with an explicit API so that the module is used in a proper and controlled way.
The users of this module should not have to know about what is inside a module it is using, and they shouldn't need to access its internal details.
Therefore, the API should be explicitly defined and ideally as small as possible.

    config =
        [ NoExposingEverything.rule
        ]

If you would like to expose everything in your tests, you can configure the rule
in the following manner:

    config =
        [ NoExposingEverything.rule
            |> Rule.ignoreErrorsForDirectories [ "tests/" ]
        ]


## Fail

    module A exposing (..)


## Success

    module A exposing (B(..), C, d)
